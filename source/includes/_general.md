# General Information

##API Status
Status, issues, and bugs for the API can be found at <a href='http://status.api.nocvp.com/'>status.api.nocvp.com</a>!
##Overview
NOCVP API exposes the entire OVP infrastructure via a standardized programmatic interface. Using NOCVP API, you can do just about anything you can do on dashboard.nocvp.com, while using your programming language of choice.
The NOCVP API is a RESTful API based on HTTP requests and JSON responses. 
This version of the API, version 1, uses OAuth 2.0. This means that all requests will need to be encrypted and sent via SSL/TLS to https://api.nocvp.com.

##Creating an API Client
In order to use NOCVP API you must create an api client and receive the client_id and client_secret.

##Endpoints
The API is accessed by making HTTP requests to endpoint URL, in which GET or POST variables contain information about what you wish to access. Every endpoint is accessed via an SSL-enabled HTTPS (port 443), this is because everything is using OAuth 2.0.

##Responses
Each response returns a valid json object or array. In case of api returns array X-Total-Count http header could be checked for the number of objects in the array.

##Paging Results
For the most part, if the API action is plural, you can page it via a query string parameter.

Query String Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
limit | optional | Limit the number of results per page. (default: 25, max: 250)
offset | optional | Page number of the result set (default: 0)

Example:
https://api.nocvp.com/v1/asset?limit=12&offset=24

#Authentication
The API requires each client to use OAuth 2 authentication. Oauth 2.0 allows a registered application/client to obtain an OAuth 2 Bearer Token, which can be used to make API requests on an applicationâ€™s own behalf, without a user context. This is called Application-only authentication.

Successful responses include a JSON-structure describing the awarded Bearer Token.

Finally, after obtaining your access_token, you make your API requests by sending the Authorization header as such:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
